# PostBank-login-executable
I am a Postbank client and it takes me 2-3 minutes to login into my account, so i made this python executable that will do it for me in a few seconds. This can be used only by postbank customers from Germany. 
This is my first ever project . 
I needed a easier way to login into my online bank account so i made this python executable with pyinstaller, 
now thanks to selenium i just click the main file in the dist folder and i receive the authentication message on my bestsing app, 
after i type in my pasword a chrome page opens on my desktop and i am logged into my account.
What use to take 2-3 minutes now can be done in seconds, how cool is that?
This app can be used by any postbank customer with an online banking account , just type in your username in the user.txt file and double click the main executable from the dist
folder , wait for your best sign app in your phone to ask for your password , type that in and you are logged in your account, 
you also get your girokonto and visa balance printed out.
